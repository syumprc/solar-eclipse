/**
@mainpage Libplinkio - Parsing plink genotype files
This is a small C and Python library for reading Plink genotype files. 

Currently it can:
- Read and parse BED, BIM and FAM files.
- Transpose BED files.

Libplinkio will reach 1.0 when it can:
- Read PED files (i.e. non-binary bed-files).
- Write BED, BIM and FAM files.

Project rationales:
- Use C to make it as simple as possible to add bindings
  for other languages.
- Focus only on IO-functionality.
- Few external dependencies to make it easy to use.

The most relevant functions can be found in plinkio.h. You then have the pio_sample_t struct and pio_locus_t struct that allows you to access meta information about individuals and snps.
