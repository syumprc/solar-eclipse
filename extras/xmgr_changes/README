This directory includes the modified XMGR source files used in SOLAR.
As a pre-compiled XMGR is now included with every standard SOLAR distribution,
it is not required for most users, but is included in case the user wishes
to further modify XMGR on their own.

The two files should be copied to the src directory of the xmgr-4.1.2
distribution before doing 'make.'
